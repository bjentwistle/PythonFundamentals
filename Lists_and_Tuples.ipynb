Lists are stored, essentially, as contiguous items in memory so that access can be as quick as possible.  However, they are mutable (they can be changed after they are created and stored) and so those mechanisms need to include extra functionality to deal with changing list sizes.\n",

        "***Note:***  *a list variable contains a reference to the start of the list in memory, rather than storing the list itself.
